# Use Twig template engine with Xaraya

Xaraya has been using Blocklayout for templates since the early days. The [Twig bridge](https://github.com/xaraya/core/blob/com.xaraya.core.bermuda/html/lib/xaraya/bridge/README.md#twig-template-engine) included in Xaraya core allows you to use Twig-based templates to generate output in Xaraya if needed, with a number of Xaraya-specific extensions.

This repository contains the Twig templates converted from Blocklayout for different modules, blocks, properties and themes.
