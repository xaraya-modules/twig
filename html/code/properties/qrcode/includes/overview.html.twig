            <h2>QRCode Property</h2>
                <h3>Description</h3>
                <p>
                    The QRCode dataproperty displays a QR code based on content passed through its attributes.  
                </p>
                <p>
                    At present the property only accepts a URL attribute. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    The property uses a third party wrapper class around a call to Google's Chart API. This API is deprecated as of 2016, and its replacement does not support QR codes. 
                    In the future this property will need to be rewritten to use some other third party library to generate the codes. But hey, as long as it works..
                </p>
                <p>
                    This property is meant to be used standalone. There is at present no input display.
                </p>
